# Hey! I'm Ethan 👋👨🏻‍💻

I’m a Computer Science student at [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au/), specialising in software engineering with an interest in backend development.

My current focus is expanding my knowledge of API development, with particular emphasis on mastering design patterns and software architecture principles.
